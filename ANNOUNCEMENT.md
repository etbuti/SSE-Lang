SSE-Lang has been formally registered and confirmed by the UK Copyright Service.

SSE-Lang defines a constraint-based semantic system for reasoning about
solid-state electrolyte materials, focusing on feasibility, structure,
and explicit judgement rather than prediction.

This release is numbered v0.1,
but it is defined as a complete first version by design,
not a provisional draft.

The system is documented as a method-level work
within the Evan Bei Insert Library.
