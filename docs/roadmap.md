# SSE-Lang — Roadmap (codename: super-duper-halibut)

1. Define SSE-Lang as a constraint-based semantic layer, not a numerical simulator.
2. Formalise allowed / forbidden rule syntax for solid-state electrolyte reasoning.
3. Implement a minimal Yes/No rule checker (offline-first, single-page).
4. Keep system transparent, human-readable, and non-black-box.
5. Separate semantic rules from experimental data.
6. Prevent large-scale model crawling and unintended training use.
7. Maintain a lightweight public reference version (non-commercial).
8. Prepare an academic-facing theoretical paper as primary anchor.
9. Allow future extensions without breaking original semantics.
10. Treat SSE-Lang as a long-term evolving language, not a product.
